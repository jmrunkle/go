# Design

## Goal

This concept exercise teaches the student about specialties of functions in Go.

## Learning objectives

- Definition of a function with parameter and return value.
- Multiple return values.
- Anonymous functions.
- Variables can hold functions.
- Functions can be parameters.
- Functions can be returned from other functions or methods.
- Ignore return values.

## Out of scope

- closure: This exercise touches functions as return values from a function but should not go into the concept of a closure.
- callback: It should also not go into details of callback functions and when to use them.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `functions`: TODO

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: know what a variable is; know how to define a variable; know how to update a variable.
- `numbers`: TODO
- `conditionals`: TODO
- `arrays`: TODO?
